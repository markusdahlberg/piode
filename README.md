# piode
One way transfer of data using two raspberry pi and a usb switch.

## background
This is by no means the only way, and most likely not the best way, to perform this operation. This project was made as an experiment that grew into the current state.

## future
We won't be putting any more time into this project, but we leave it here in case it is useful to someone, in whole or part.
